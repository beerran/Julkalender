Utilizes JavaScript, Stylus and some leftover CoffeeScript.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n- Install [Meteor](http://meteor.com)\r\n- Download or clone this into /some/path\r\n- cd /some/path\r\n- Run `meteor`\r\n\r\n# Admin privileges\r\nDuring the upstart of the application it checks the number of registered users, if there is only one, he/she will be given admin privileges. So after the installation steps are finished, simply register a user in the app, then kill the server and start it up again with `meteor`.\r\n",
