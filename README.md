A project Euler clone written with the lovely Meteor framework. Utilizes JavaScript, Bootstrap and some leftover CoffeeScript.

# Installation
- Install [Meteor](http://meteor.com)
- Download or clone this into /some/path
- cd /some/path
- Run `meteor`

# Admin privileges
During the upstart of the application it checks the number of registered users, if there is only one, he/she will be given admin privileges. So after the installation steps are finished, simply register a user in the app, then kill the server and start it up again with `meteor`.
